Here you can find a Dockerfile that can create a small docker image with Apache Celix and INAETICS built in it.
To use this dockerfile :
First, build the dockerfile by running the following command : docker build -t "name-of-your-image" .

BE CAREFUL : 
	-You need to have the same docker version than there is in the image, in the image I'm using the latest version
	of docker by running the following command : wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
	-The configuration file of Buildroot is dependent of the version of buildroot your using. If you want to change 
	Buildroot version you have to create a new configuration file with the new Buildroot. 
	Put it into a git reposirtory, and change the git repository in the Dockerfile.

If you want more information about the dockerfile, see the comments in the Dockerfile.
